CIF - Configurable IP Filter

This is a Linux (2.6, originally 2.4) module written by me circa 2003~2004 to control access to online gaming servers ran by Sanane/AvaTurk/Oynasana.

It features port-latching rules, rule expiration and time reporting.

It is my first non-trivial C project, my first Linux program and my first kernel module, developed for the first assignment of my first job.
